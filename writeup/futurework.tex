VII. Future Work (.75pg)

* What properties are available?
	* We've focused on ACID Isolation, but there are lots of other models to consider?
	* Which consistency criteria? Which models? There are infinite, so how do we choose?
	* Set ourselves up for APEs

* Full exploration of HAT space
	* Many parameters; $2^10$ models at the least
	* Need to mitigate the cost of tracking causality with high availability
		* The cost moving from S-HA (like Eiger) to truly HA (R-HA) seems to be high
		* e.g., Eiger relies on metadata GC to keep writes small; is O(|keys|) in limit
			* Not meant as a fault--it's optimized for a particular scenario--but curious to consider

* Revisit semantics-based concurrency control
	* Could taxonomize properties like escrow
	* Can also consider models with SLAs and bounded messaging asynchrony
	* Our focus is on "classic" distributed systems trade-off
		* However, lots of interesting hybrids (maybe cite Doug Terry's recent stuff)
