* System model
	* Consider transactions that issue a series of reads and writes, then commit or abort
	* Each data item is located on one or more servers

* HA Definitions
	* Straw-man definition: every transaction will recieve a response
		* Problem: system that always aborts is trivially available!

* Replica-HA
	* (Handwaving in the outline) If a client can contact at least one replica for each data item in a transaction, then the transaction will eventually commit, even in the presence of infinite network partitions.

* Sticky-HA
	* If a client continues to contact the same set of replicas across transactions and the client can contact at least one replica for each data item in a transaciton, then the transaction will eventually commit, even in the presence of infinite network partitions.
	* We will use this definition when it comes to causality and read your writes guarantees!
	* Can be achieved by either "sticking" clients to the same set of servers or by having the client act as a replica itself, via caching
