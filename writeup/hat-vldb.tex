\title{Highly Available Transactions: Virtues and Limitations}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Given the presence of network latency and the possibility of partial
failure and network partitions, many modern distributed systems eschew
transactional functionality, which provides strong semantic guarantees
on groups of multiple operations over multiple data items. In this
work, we consider the problem of providing transactional guarantees
that are highly available, or do not suffer from unavailability during
system partitions or typically incur high network latency.  We
introduce a new taxonomy of highly available algorithms and analyze a
combination of ACID and distributed consistency guarantees to identify
which can and cannot be achieved by Highly Available Transaction (HAT)
systems. In doing so, we analytically and experimentally quantify the
benefit of providing high availability as well as the associated
semantic costs.
