INTRO

references from start:
"Fragmentwise serializability"
"Achieving Robustness in Distributed Databases"
"Database Replication Techniques: 3 parameter class"--Kemme

Add a punchline to the contributions list

MOTIVATION

"as evidenced by the lack of..." <-- citation here would be good

Partial and fully replicated system <-- citation here

definition of HA earlier on

awk header at start of 2.3

HAT SECTION

Oracle Read Consistency implementation <--citation

Read Uncommitted vs. Serializability example

Fix model composition on difficulty of composing certain models

Should we move the hybrid part?

EVALUATION

define coordination

justify claims re: existing systems that aren't serializable

"Absent a necessary" -> awkward

GENERAL

need to pull out HAT part of every guarantee


--Where do we define HA?



Joe:

why say DBMS? (in 2.3)
formal definitions
Read Committed: invites quibbling; why?
4.1.2: T_2 read y=1, so it had to have come after T_1
4.1.3: why are sessions a "natural concern"? can you explain "discuss write buffering"? is the idea that the client might cache her own writes?
4.2: "how do you know that you've exhausted the range of useful hat semantics?" what I want to say here is that, if you look at berenson, these are all that are HAT; here are the rest
