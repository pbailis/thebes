 > W1. While the understanding and insights are useful, this paper still leaves it at an abstraction level. For instance, how can a practitioner use this knowledge to design systems? If availability is a requirement, do we chose the strongest form of consistency that is highly available or is there another tradeoff with performance (aka request latency). That is, reduction and application of these ideas to practice is unclear. A few compelling application scenarios (beyond TPC-C, which is not a great application for the target environment for HAT) would be beneficial.

 > D2. Section 5 mentions that stickiness can also be implemented with client-side caching. However, the implications of actual server stickiness and client-side caching are not the same. Ensuring causal consistency is a good differentiator. For instance, if the client session stays connected to the same server even after a network partition, causality can still be guaranteed. However, if stickiness is emulated by client-side caching, a client might never have seen a write on which it causally depends due to transitivity. Caching such writes at the client becomes impractical. This needs to be clarified.

 > D3.I did not entirely follow the discussion on transaction atomicity. In my understanding, atomicity just says all or nothing. It does have a subtle relationship with isolation in the non-failure case. For a non-distributed transaction, if the isolation level allows dirty reads, it implies that if T2 read from what T1 (an uncommitted transaction) wrote, then T2's cannot commit until T1 commits as it would violate atomicity and if T1 aborts, T2 must also abort (causing cascading aborts), which is why dirty reads are often avoided. However, atomicity also has an implication with failures such that when a server fails, all in-flight transaction's work must be undone. Similarly, in the distributed case, atomicity means that either the transaction commits at all participating sites or at none of the sites. 2PC just gives you atomicity while an additional concurrency control mechanism, such as 2PL or OCC, is still needed for isolation. A clarification along these lines will be useful.

 > D5. For the discussion following Writes Follows Reads, is there an assumption that the underlying storage layer is multi-version? If not, then isn't holding back a client's write equivalent to blocking it, which will result in unavailability as the blocking can be indefinite. If multi-version, then wouldn't holding back writes potentially prevent the system from surfacing any recent writes? That is, is there a possibility that even though the system continues accepting writes, none of the subsequent reads from other sessions see those writes? In that case, the system might be available but not "alive." Elaborate on this.

 > - Section 2 discusses why high availability is important, providing both anecdotal and experimental evidence for mitigating the effects of network partitions and inter-data center latencies. The latency data study provided in Section 2.2 is very nice and summarizes/motivates the paper nicely. While this paper is replete with references, but it might be appropriate to reference the Bobtail paper here (Xu et al., NSDI 2013). 
 > 
 > - Section 3 discusses the need for various isolation levels in practice and provides a survey of the highest (and default) isolation levels provided by 18 "traditional" and NewSQL database systems. This work appeared in a previous workshop paper and the paper clearly mention this. While this survey helps motivate this work, it could be shortened in favor of more novel content (e.g., details of the TA implementation). 
 > 
 > - Section 5 contains the main contribution of the paper by providing a discussion of what isolation guarantees are possible (and not possible) in a highly available distributed system. The paper uses classifications and terminology from from Adya (as well as Berenson et al.) in this discussion. This section lends clarity to the design space for highly-available transactions; a contribution that has potential to influence the future design of distributed storage systems. The classification of "sticky" and "non-sticky" availability is quite nice. The explanations and examples are incredibly clear and digestible. While some of the guarantee discussions sacrifice formality for brevity, it might be a good idea to bring in some formality to help the paper be better self-contained (that, or provide more implementation details to get the idea across). As is, the paper provides a single-paragraph algorithmic sketch for each HAT guarantee. Adding more detail about the TA algorithm would help greatly, since TA seems to be a contribution itself (reducing some of the "motivation" sections 2 and 3 could help). This would also help interpretation of the experimental results. This paper does have an associated technical report - and I expect a future journal article will combine this content (and more).

 > D1. The biggest weakness of this paper is that the its definition of high-availability is very strict - so strict that it excludes all so-called highly-available database systems that I am aware of: Spanner, Megastore, NoSQL systems like Cassandra, log shipping to hot standbys in RDBMS, and more. It is interesting to consider what kinds of consistency are achievable under such a strict HA requirement (as this paper does), but I wonder whether this will have any impact on practice. 
 > 
 > D2. This paper focuses on the tradeoffs between availability and consistency. It does not mention durability of updates. You can't have a HAT system and also ensure that committed updates are geo-replicated (or replicated at all). It seems that HAT is a very demanding god... 
 > 
 > D3. Section 2.1 is supposed to be about partitions, but many the statistics being reported (e.g., in paragraph 3) are for link failures, router failures, and other things (WAN and LAN) that may or may not result in partitioning. Can you relate any of this stuff to partitioning? Right now, it feels like you are hand-waving about network-related failures in general. 
 > 
 > D4. Section (2nd paragraph) says that HA algs "ensure...guaranteed low latency". I see nothing about latency in any of the subsequent definitions. I understand that reduced latency can be a beneficial side-effect of designing for HA, but here you seem to be suggesting that the *definition* of HA has to do with low latency. 
 > 
 > D5. I'm puzzled by the definition of "sticky" availability. You indicate that a client be "sticky" by maintaining affinity with a set of servers, rather than a single server. However, the sticky availability definition seems to a require that a single server observe all of a client's requests. So, which is it? On the one hand, if not all servers can handle requests for all objects, then it would seem that you need to allow a client to be sticky with a set of servers. On the other hand, this means that no server observes all requests. Also, if a client can be sticky by sending its requests to a set of servers, then aren't all clients sticky (considering the 
 > set consisting of all servers). Since you are later going to actually classify algorithms based on this definition, I think it needs to be clarified. 
 > 
 > D6. Transactional availability (Section 4.2) requires "replica availability", which is not defined. Does it correspond to what you previously called "traditional availability"? Also, why does the last sentence in Section 4.2 talk about the client's ability to contact *two* servers per data item? 
 > 
 > D7. Section 5.1.2 says that item cut isolation plus TA prevents read skew. I don't understand how this can be. TA allows a transaction that is reading multiple data items to observe only part of the effect of another transaction that updates those items - isn't that read skew? (And item cut isolation doesn't help.) More generally, I'm not really convinced of the utility of TA to applications - perhaps that explains its perplexing absence from existing treatments of weak isolation? 
 > 
 > D8. It seems that the TA algorithm you propose (Section 5.1.2) will not play well with enforcing item cut isolation using caching, as you propose. If a transaction reads an item a second time, the latter may be trying to feed it an old value while former is compelled to feed a newer value (to preserve TA). You presumably want these two algs to play nicely together if TA plus item cut isolation somehow prevent read skew (in some way that I do not understand) as you claim.
