VI. Related Work (.75pg)

* Probably do a good job with this one, in addition to the first part of Section V. We can talk at length about the relationship between distributed systems and databases.

1.) High Availability and CAP (giving the DB folks due credit here!)
2.) Highly Available Distributed Systems
3.) Weak Isolation (there's a lot here, pay plenty of lip service to Adya)
4.) Available/unavailable systems
	--Stress that, with the advent of Spanner, transactions are coming back; HATS represents new design space. (Can even say "Spanner borrowed traditional database techniques; would benefit from HAT approach (c.f., 100ms geo-replicated latencies)"; also talk about optimization for read-only transactions).
